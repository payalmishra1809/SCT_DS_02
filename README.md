🚢 Titanic Data Analysis Project
This project performs high-level Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. It uncovers the hidden patterns that determined who survived the tragedy.

📊 Key Highlights
Data Imputation: Handled missing values in the "Age" and "Embarked" features using statistical methods.

Feature Selection: Cleaned the dataset by removing high-cardinality and redundant features.

Visual Insights: Created a 3-panel dashboard to visualize survival rates across Gender, Social Class, and Age demographics.

📉 Results Summary
Gender Impact: The analysis confirms a significantly higher survival rate for females, following the "women and children first" protocol.

Socio-Economic Status: Passengers in 1st Class had the highest survival probability, highlighting the disparity in safety access.

Age Factors: Children under 10 had a distinct survival advantage compared to other age groups.
